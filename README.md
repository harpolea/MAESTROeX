# MAESTROeX
a C++/F90 low Mach number stellar hydrodynamics code

MAESTROeX solves the equations of low Mach number hydrodynamics for
stratified atmospheres/stars with a general equation of state. It
includes reactions and thermal diffusion and can be used on anything
from a single core to 100,000s of processor cores with MPI + OpenMP.

A description of the algorithm and links to the algorithm papers can be found here:
